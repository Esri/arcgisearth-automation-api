# ArcGIS Earth Automation API
ArcGIS Earth Automation API provides a standard interface for 3rd party applications that support .NET to automate and communicate with ArcGIS Earth. The Automation API is based on [.NET WCF NamedPipe](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.servicemodel.netnamedpipebinding(v=vs.110).aspx). It provides a fast and reliable way for on-machine communications.
